                    <p class="p">Skwiz is a play on the word exsquisite (“ik-Skwiz-it”). It’s the mobile drawing game where multiple people create one drawing without knowledge of what the others have contributed - until the end. It is the digital version of the surrealist drawing game “Exquisite Corpse,” in which players fold up a piece of paper, and pass it around so that each collaborator can only see the section they are drawing.</p>

                    <h2 class="h3">How do you play?</h2>
                    <p class="p">Participants play by taking turns drawing sections of one canvas. Because the canvas is clearly divided into three sections, players pass along their contributions without knowledge of what the other players have drawn in the other two sections, until the reveal at the end. It is required that the players who draw the top or middle section, extend the lines from the bottom of their drawing, breaking the pink dotted line at the bottom of the screen. This enables the next player to accurately connect their section of the drawing, without seeing the drawing above. Once the third player hits “done”, the entire canvas is revealed.</p>

                    <p class="p">Exquisite Corpse is a visual parlour game invented in 1925 in Paris by the surrealists Yves Tanguy, Jacques Prévert, André Breton and Marcel Duchamp. The object of the game is for multiple people to create one bizarre drawing, without knowledge of what their collaborators have contributed. Participants begin by folding a piece of paper into sections (usually into thirds). Participants then take turns drawing sections of a body, or anything they want, on the sheet of paper and folding each section to hide the individual contributions. The first player adds a head, or anything they want — then, without knowing what that previous drawing looks like, the next artist adds a torso, or anything they want, and so on. The name ‘cadavre exquis’ was derived from a phrase that resulted when they first played the game, ‘le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau’ (‘the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine’). André Breton writes that the game developed at the residence of friends at an old house on 54 rue du Château, Montparnasse, Paris. It’s a game that unites the subconscious from multiple people onto one canvas.</p>
